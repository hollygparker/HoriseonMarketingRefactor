# Purpose 
The purpose of this challenge was to refactor the given code to improve accessibility by using semantic HTML and alt attributes for Horiseon Marketing's clientele. 

# My Experience
I enjoyed analyzing the code to condense and re-order the CSS to make more sense. I also enjoyed creating the alt attributes for the images.
